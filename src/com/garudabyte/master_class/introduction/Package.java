/*
packages
-> programmers can easily determine that the classes are related
-> it is easy to know where to find the classes and interfaces can provide the function provided by the package
-> because the package creates a new namespace, class and interface name conflicts are avoided
-> classes within the package can have unresricted access to one another while still restricting access for classess outside the package
